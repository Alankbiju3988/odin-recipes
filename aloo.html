        <p>Eggplant, potatoes, and tomatoes make up Baingan aloo ki subji, <br>
           a flavorful vegetable curry that vegetarians and vegans can enjoy. <br>
           Like many Indian dishes, the blend of spices tastes even better a <br>
           day or so afterward so the flavors have time to get to know each <br>
           other. Pair it with hot chapatis and cool raita and chutney.</p>
