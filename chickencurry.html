        <h1>Basic Chicken Curry</h1>
        <img src="images/chickencurry.png" alt="chicken curry">
        <p>Making curry the authentic way, by blending spices yourself, <br>
           results in a much more robust, fragrant dish than store-bought <br>
           curry sauce or pre-blended powder. This chicken curry comes <br>
           together in 45 minutes and requires very little active time. <br>
           Serve with chapati or boiled rice.</p>
